CSS Intermediate Folder - Liquid Layout
This repository contains an intermediate level CSS project created as part of an academic assignment, focusing on the concept of a liquid layout. The liquid layout is a responsive design approach that allows the content to adapt and resize according to the user's viewport or screen size.

Folder Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the project.
css/: This directory contains the CSS files for styling the HTML content.
styles.css: The main CSS file where the liquid layout concepts are implemented.
reset.css: A CSS file that resets default styles to ensure consistency across different browsers.
assets/: This directory stores any additional assets such as images or fonts used in the project.
Development
To further explore or contribute to this project, follow these steps:
